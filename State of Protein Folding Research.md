# State of Protein Folding Research
## September 23, 2025

### Executive Summary

Protein folding research stands at an inflection point in 2025. While AlphaFold and its successors have largely solved static structure prediction, the field has pivoted toward understanding dynamics, kinetics, and functional mechanisms. The consensus foundations—energy landscapes, chaperone systems, and folding thermodynamics—remain robust. However, major challenges persist in predicting folding pathways, simulating large-scale dynamics, understanding co-translational folding, and designing proteins with switchable functions.

Key developments in 2024-2025 include: AlphaFold3's expansion to protein-nucleic acid complexes, breakthroughs in ribosome-mediated folding control, and new insights into intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) phase separation mechanisms. Leading labs at MIT, UCSF, Cambridge, and industry players like DeepMind/Isomorphic Labs drive progress through hybrid physics-ML approaches. The frontier now lies in bridging structure to dynamics, from milliseconds to seconds, and from in vitro to in-cell reality.

Critical gaps remain in: predicting complete folding kinetics from sequence, simulating proteins >500 residues with converged statistics, and obtaining atomistic in-cell folding trajectories. These represent the field's "impossible problems"—challenges that may require fundamental algorithmic breakthroughs or new experimental physics to overcome.

## 1. Consensus Foundations (What We're Sure About)

### 1.1 Energy Landscapes and Folding Theory

The energy landscape theory, solidified over decades, treats protein folding as a biased search through conformational space toward the native state. The "folding funnel" concept—where the landscape is shaped like a funnel with the native state at the bottom—explains both the robustness and speed of folding despite Levinthal's paradox.

**Levinthal's Paradox Resolution**: Modern understanding recognizes that proteins don't sample conformations randomly but follow biased pathways down the energy funnel. The hydrophobic effect drives initial collapse, reducing the search space dramatically. Subsequent formation of secondary structures and their assembly is guided by local interactions that progressively narrow the conformational ensemble.

**Two-State vs Multi-State Folding**: Small proteins (<100 residues) typically fold via apparent two-state kinetics (unfolded ↔ folded), while larger proteins often populate intermediates. The distinction isn't absolute—even "two-state" folders may have transient intermediates invisible to bulk measurements.

**Key Thermodynamic Drivers**:
- Hydrophobic effect: ~60-70% of folding free energy
- Backbone hydrogen bonding: Stabilizes secondary structures
- Side-chain packing: Fine-tunes stability and specificity
- Conformational entropy loss: Major opposing force

### 1.2 In Vivo Folding Environment

**Co-translational Folding**: Proteins begin folding during synthesis on the ribosome. The ribosome exit tunnel (~80 Å long, 10-20 Å wide) constrains nascent chains and can influence folding. Recent work shows the ribosome actively modulates folding through specific interactions with nascent chains.

**Chaperone Systems**: Well-characterized systems include:
- **Trigger Factor** (bacteria): First chaperone engaging nascent chains
- **Hsp70/DnaK**: ATP-dependent, binds hydrophobic segments
- **Hsp90**: Late-stage folding, especially for kinases and steroid receptors  
- **GroEL/GroES**: Anfinsen cage providing isolated folding environment
- **TRiC/CCT** (eukaryotes): Essential for actin, tubulin folding

Chaperones are essential for ~10-20% of proteins, helpful for ~30-50%, and dispensable for the remainder under normal conditions.

### 1.3 Misfolding and Aggregation

Protein aggregation follows predictable patterns:
- **Amyloid formation**: β-sheet-rich fibrillar structures with cross-β spine
- **Amorphous aggregates**: Less ordered, often reversible
- **Inclusion bodies**: Dense aggregates in bacteria, sometimes functional

Aggregation-prone regions (APRs) can be predicted with ~80% accuracy using sequence-based algorithms (TANGO, PASTA, Zyggregator).

### 1.4 Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/Regions (IDPs/IDRs)

~30% of eukaryotic proteins contain significant disorder (>30 residues). IDPs:
- Lack stable tertiary structure in isolation
- Often fold upon binding partners
- Drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
- Enriched in signaling and regulatory proteins

Phase separation is driven by multivalent weak interactions, with aromatic residues and arginine as key drivers.

### 1.5 Computational Structure Prediction Landscape

**What AlphaFold/ESMFold/RoseTTAFold Guarantee**:
- Static backbone coordinates (typically <2 Å RMSD for well-folded domains)
- Relative domain orientations (with lower confidence)
- Confident secondary structure assignments

**What They Don't Capture**:
- Folding pathways or kinetics
- Conformational dynamics
- Effects of mutations on folding rates
- Transient intermediates
- Allosteric mechanisms
- Real-time response to cellular conditions
- Most IDR conformational ensembles

## 2. Frontline Challenges (2024-2025 Focus)

### 2.1 Accurate Dynamics & Kinetics Prediction

**Why It's Hard**: Folding occurs over timescales from microseconds to minutes. Transition states are fleeting (<1% population) and experimentally invisible. Current MD simulations max out at milliseconds for small proteins.

**State of the Art**:

## 4. "What We Don't Dare (Yet)"

### 4.1 Complete Folding Kinetics from Sequence

**The Challenge**: Predict complete folding pathways, rates, and intermediates from amino acid sequence alone, accounting for cellular conditions, PTMs, and chaperones.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Transition states are fleeting and sequence-dependent in non-obvious ways
- Cellular conditions vary spatially and temporally
- PTM timing relative to folding is protein-specific
- Chaperone interactions add stochastic elements

**Dissenting Views**: Some groups (Shaw Research, Baker Lab) believe this will be tractable within 5-10 years through combination of massive simulation and ML.

### 4.2 Ab Initio Simulation of Large Proteins

**The Challenge**: Simulate folding of >500 residue proteins from unfolded to native state in explicit solvent with converged statistics.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Would require exascale computing for years per protein
- Force field errors accumulate over long trajectories
- Rare events dominate but are impossibly expensive to sample
- Water model limitations become critical at long timescales

**Current Limits**: ~100 residues for millisecond timescales (Anton 3)

### 4.3 In-Cell Atomistic Folding Movies

**The Challenge**: Observe individual protein molecules folding in living cells at atomic resolution in real-time.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Optical resolution limit (~200 nm) >> protein size (~5 nm)
- Labels perturb folding
- Cells are crowded and heterogeneous
- Timescales (μs-s) require impossible frame rates at high resolution

**Best Current**: In-cell NMR provides ensemble averages; super-resolution reaches ~20 nm

### 4.4 Reliable Design of Allosteric Switches

**The Challenge**: Design large (>300 residue) membrane protein complexes with programmable allostery and dynamic switching between 3+ functional states.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Allostery emerges from subtle energetic balance
- Membrane environment critical but hard to model
- Negative design space (avoiding unwanted states) is vast
- Evolution required millions of years; we have months

**Current State**: Simple two-state switches in soluble proteins <150 residues

### 4.5 Unified Predictive Framework

**The Challenge**: Single model predicting folding, function, evolution, and disease mutations with experimental accuracy.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Different phenomena occur at incompatible scales (fs to years)
- Evolutionary constraints differ from physical constraints
- Disease mutations often have subtle, context-dependent effects
- Function requires dynamics, not just structure

**Reality Check**: Even connecting structure to function remains largely empirical

### Negative Results & Retractions

- Claims of quantum effects in folding (Copenhagen group) failed reproduction
- Several early ML folding predictors shown to memorize rather than generalize
- Proposed universal folding code (MIT group) restricted to small two-state proteins

### Hype vs Reality Audit

**Overhyped**:
- "AlphaFold solved biology" - Still can't predict dynamics or function
- "Quantum computers will revolutionize folding" - Still 10+ years away
- "De novo enzymes rival natural ones" - Still 10^4-10^6 fold worse

**Underappreciated**:

# State of Protein Folding Research
## September 23, 2025

### Executive Summary

Protein folding research stands at an inflection point in 2025. While AlphaFold and its successors have largely solved static structure prediction, the field has pivoted toward understanding dynamics, kinetics, and functional mechanisms. The consensus foundations—energy landscapes, chaperone systems, and folding thermodynamics—remain robust. However, major challenges persist in predicting folding pathways, simulating large-scale dynamics, understanding co-translational folding, and designing proteins with switchable functions.

Key developments in 2024-2025 include: AlphaFold3's expansion to protein-nucleic acid complexes, breakthroughs in ribosome-mediated folding control, and new insights into intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) phase separation mechanisms. Leading labs at MIT, UCSF, Cambridge, and industry players like DeepMind/Isomorphic Labs drive progress through hybrid physics-ML approaches. The frontier now lies in bridging structure to dynamics, from milliseconds to seconds, and from in vitro to in-cell reality.

Critical gaps remain in: predicting complete folding kinetics from sequence, simulating proteins >500 residues with converged statistics, and obtaining atomistic in-cell folding trajectories. These represent the field's "impossible problems"—challenges that may require fundamental algorithmic breakthroughs or new experimental physics to overcome.

---

## 1. Consensus Foundations (What We're Sure About)

### 1.1 Energy Landscapes and Folding Theory

The energy landscape theory, solidified over decades, treats protein folding as a biased search through conformational space toward the native state. The "folding funnel" concept—where the landscape is shaped like a funnel with the native state at the bottom—explains both the robustness and speed of folding despite Levinthal's paradox.

**Levinthal's Paradox Resolution**: Modern understanding recognizes that proteins don't sample 
conformations randomly but follow biased pathways down the energy funnel. The hydrophobic effect drives initial collapse, reducing the search space dramatically. Subsequent formation of secondary structures and their assembly is guided by local interactions that progressively narrow the conformational ensemble.

**Two-State vs Multi-State Folding**: Small proteins (<100 residues) typically fold via apparent two-state kinetics (unfolded ↔ folded), while larger proteins often populate intermediates. The distinction isn't absolute—even "two-state" folders may have transient intermediates invisible to bulk measurements.

**Key Thermodynamic Drivers**:
- Hydrophobic effect: ~60-70% of folding free energy
- Backbone hydrogen bonding: Stabilizes secondary structures
- Side-chain packing: Fine-tunes stability and specificity
- Conformational entropy loss: Major opposing force

### 1.2 In Vivo Folding Environment

**Co-translational Folding**: Proteins begin folding during synthesis on the ribosome. The ribosome exit tunnel (~80 Å long, 10-20 Å wide) constrains nascent chains and can influence folding. Recent work shows the ribosome actively modulates folding through specific interactions with nascent chains.

**Chaperone Systems**: Well-characterized systems include:
- **Trigger Factor** (bacteria): First chaperone engaging nascent chains
- **Hsp70/DnaK**: ATP-dependent, binds hydrophobic segments
- **Hsp90**: Late-stage folding, especially for kinases and steroid receptors  
- **GroEL/GroES**: Anfinsen cage providing isolated folding environment
- **TRiC/CCT** (eukaryotes): Essential for actin, tubulin folding

Chaperones are essential for ~10-20% of proteins, helpful for ~30-50%, and dispensable for the remainder under normal conditions.

### 1.3 Misfolding and Aggregation

Protein aggregation follows predictable patterns:
- **Amyloid formation**: β-sheet-rich fibrillar structures with cross-β spine
- **Amorphous aggregates**: Less ordered, often reversible
- **Inclusion bodies**: Dense aggregates in bacteria, sometimes functional

Aggregation-prone regions (APRs) can be predicted with ~80% accuracy using sequence-based algorithms (TANGO, PASTA, Zyggregator).

### 1.4 Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/Regions (IDPs/IDRs)

~30% of eukaryotic proteins contain significant disorder (>30 residues). IDPs:
- Lack stable tertiary structure in isolation
- Often fold upon binding partners
- Drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
- Enriched in signaling and regulatory proteins

## 2. Frontline Challenges (2024-2025 Focus)

### 2.1 Accurate Dynamics & Kinetics Prediction

**Why It's Hard**: Folding occurs over timescales from microseconds to minutes. Transition states are fleeting (<1% population) and experimentally invisible. Current MD simulations max out at milliseconds for small proteins.

**State of the Art**: 
- Anton 3 achieves millisecond simulations for ~100 residue proteins
- Markov State Models extract kinetics from shorter trajectories
- Machine learning force fields (NeuralMD, SchNet) accelerate sampling 10-100x

**Open Bottlenecks**:
- Sampling rare events remains prohibitive
- Force field accuracy limits quantitative rate predictions
- Validation data scarce (φ-value analysis, T-jump experiments)

**Key Datasets/Benchmarks**:
- CASP-Commons: Folding trajectories for 20 proteins
- K-FOLD: Experimental folding rates for 120 two-state proteins

**Leading Groups**:
- D.E. Shaw Research (Anton simulations)
- Pande Lab/Folding@home (distributed computing)
- Bowman Lab, Washington University (Markov State Models)

### 2.2 Free-Energy Landscapes at Atomistic Resolution

**Why It's Hard**: Complete landscapes require exhaustive sampling of conformational space. Water and ion effects are critical but computationally expensive. Large proteins have astronomical numbers of local minima.

**State of the Art**:
- Metadynamics and umbrella sampling for <50 residue proteins
- AlphaFold-enhanced sampling using structure predictions as restraints
- Coarse-grained models capture qualitative features for larger systems

**Open Bottlenecks**:
- Quantitative accuracy for ΔG predictions (~2-3 kcal/mol errors)
- Incorporating post-translational modifications
- Multi-protein systems remain intractable

**Leading Groups**:
- Parrinello Group, ETH Zurich (enhanced sampling methods)
- Sugita Lab, RIKEN (GENESIS MD package)
- Brooks Group, University of Michigan (CHARMM development)

### 2.3 Membrane Proteins & Assemblies

**Why It's Hard**: Lipid bilayers add complexity. Insertion/folding coupled processes. Limited structural data compared to soluble proteins. Detergents used experimentally may not recapitulate native environment.

**State of the Art**:
- Coarse-grained MARTINI simulations for insertion
- AlphaFold-Multimer for complex prediction
- Cryo-EM providing dynamics snapshots

**Open Bottlenecks**:
- Lipid composition effects poorly understood
- Oligomerization predictions unreliable
- Translocon-assisted insertion mechanisms unclear

**Leading Groups**:
- von Heijne Lab, Stockholm University (insertion mechanisms)
- Sansom Lab, Oxford (multiscale simulations)
- White Lab, UC Irvine (membrane protein folding)

### 2.4 Co-translational Folding on the Ribosome

**Why It's Hard**: Nascent chain emerges vectorially (N→C terminus). Ribosome surface interactions are complex. Translation rates vary and affect folding. Difficult to study experimentally in real-time.

**Recent Breakthroughs** (2024-2025):
- Ribosome shown to delay domain docking in multidomain proteins
- Trigger Factor-ribosome cooperation mapped at peptide resolution
- Translation pausing sites identified as folding checkpoints

- Coupling to chaperone recruitment

**Leading Groups**:
- Frydman Lab, Stanford (ribosome profiling)
- Bukau Lab, Heidelberg (co-translational chaperones)
- Kramer Lab, UT Austin (nascent chain dynamics)

### 2.5 Chaperone-Coupled Folding

**Why It's Hard**: Chaperones are dynamic machines with complex ATPase cycles. Client specificity rules remain unclear. Multiple chaperones often act sequentially. Concentrations in cells are heterogeneous.

**State of the Art**:
- GroEL mechanism well-understood at structural level
- Hsp70 code partially deciphered (hydrophobic patterns)
- Client transfer pathways being mapped

**Recent Advances** (2025):
- Structures and mechanisms of chaperone targeting identified
- Machine learning predicts chaperone clients with 75% accuracy

**Open Bottlenecks**:

- Designing chaperone-independent proteins

**Leading Groups**:
- Hartl Lab, Max Planck Biochemistry
- Horwich Lab, Yale (GroEL mechanisms)
- Gestwicki Lab, UCSF (Hsp70/90 allostery)

### 2.6 PTMs & Cellular Crowding Effects

**Why It's Hard**: >400 types of PTMs exist. Timing relative to folding varies. Crowding effects are non-additive. In-cell measurements technically challenging.

**State of the Art**:
- In-cell NMR reveals crowding-induced stabilization
- Phosphomimetics approximate phosphorylation effects
- Glycosylation shown to accelerate folding in some cases

**Open Bottlenecks**:
- PTM crosstalk and combinatorial effects
- Crowding beyond excluded volume (weak interactions)
- Organelle-specific folding environments

**Leading Groups**:
- Gierasch Lab, UMass (in-cell folding)
- Pielak Lab, UNC (crowding effects)
- Imperiali Lab, MIT (glycoprotein folding)

### 2.7 IDPs/IDRs and Phase Separation

**Why It's Hard**: IDPs lack single structures—exist as ensembles. Phase separation is concentration and environment-dependent. Sequence grammar for LLPS incompletely understood. Disease mutations often subtle.

**State of the Art** (2025):
- Correlated segments, not just composition, drive phase separation
- Aromatic residues and arginine identified as key drivers
- Machine learning achieves ~80% prediction accuracy for PS-prone IDRs

**Open Bottlenecks**:
- Predicting phase diagrams from sequence
- Dynamics inside condensates
- Functional vs pathological phase separation

**Leading Groups**:
- Hyman Lab, MPI-CBG (phase separation mechanisms)
- Pappu Lab, Washington University (IDP simulations)
- Mittag Lab, St. Jude (sequence determinants)

### 2.8 Generative Protein Design Beyond Static Structures

**Why It's Hard**: Function requires dynamics. Design space is vast. Negative design (avoiding misfolding) as important as positive design. Experimental validation is slow.

**State of the Art**:
- RFdiffusion/ProteinMPNN design novel folds reliably
- Switch proteins with 2-3 stable states designed
- De novo enzymes with modest activities (kcat/KM ~ 10^3-10^4)

**Open Bottlenecks**:
- Designing specific dynamics/allostery
- Multi-state equilibria control
- Evolvability of designed proteins

**Leading Groups**:
- Baker Lab, University of Washington (Rosetta/RF methods)
- Kuhlman Lab, UNC (protein switches)
- Tawfik Lab, Weizmann (design evolution)

### 2.9 Experimental Resolution Limits

**Why It's Hard**: Folding is fast (μs-s). Single molecules behave stochastically. Proteins are small (~5 nm). Need multiple observables simultaneously.

**State of the Art**:
- Single-molecule FRET reaches ~10 μs time resolution
- Cryo-EM time-resolved to seconds
- XFEL captures femtosecond dynamics
- NMR provides ensemble dynamics at atomic resolution

**Open Bottlenecks**:
- Gap between ensemble and single-molecule measurements
- In-cell measurements with molecular resolution
- Capturing transition states directly

**Leading Groups**:
- Schuler Lab, University of Zurich (single-molecule)
- Frank Lab, Columbia (time-resolved cryo-EM)
- Kern Lab, Brandeis (NMR dynamics)

### 2.10 Simulation at Scale

**Why It's Hard**: Millisecond simulations require months of supercomputer time. Force field limitations compound with simulation length. Rare events dominate kinetics but are hard to sample.

**State of the Art**:
- Specialized hardware (Anton 3, GPUs) enables longer trajectories
- Enhanced sampling (metadynamics, replica exchange) accelerates convergence
- Machine learning force fields 100x faster but less accurate

**Open Bottlenecks**:
- Polarizable force fields too expensive
- Quantum effects (proton transfer) ignored
- Validation of enhanced sampling methods

**Leading Groups**:
- Shaw Research (Anton development)
- Shirts Lab, University of Colorado (free energy methods)
- Noé Lab, Free University Berlin (ML for MD)

## 4. "What We Don't Dare (Yet)"

### 4.1 Complete Folding Kinetics from Sequence

**The Challenge**: Predict complete folding pathways, rates, and intermediates from amino acid sequence alone, accounting for cellular conditions, PTMs, and chaperones.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Transition states are fleeting and sequence-dependent in non-obvious ways
- Cellular conditions vary spatially and temporally
- PTM timing relative to folding is protein-specific
- Chaperone interactions add stochastic elements

**Dissenting Views**: Some groups (Shaw Research, Baker Lab) believe this will be tractable within 5-10 years through combination of massive simulation and ML.

### 4.2 Ab Initio Simulation of Large Proteins

**The Challenge**: Simulate folding of >500 residue proteins from unfolded to native state in explicit solvent with converged statistics.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Would require exascale computing for years per protein
- Force field errors accumulate over long trajectories
- Rare events dominate but are impossibly expensive to sample
- Water model limitations become critical at long timescales

**Current Limits**: ~100 residues for millisecond timescales (Anton 3)

### 4.3 In-Cell Atomistic Folding Movies

**The Challenge**: Observe individual protein molecules folding in living cells at atomic resolution in real-time.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Optical resolution limit (~200 nm) >> protein size (~5 nm)
- Labels perturb folding
- Cells are crowded and heterogeneous
- Timescales (μs-s) require impossible frame rates at high resolution

**Best Current**: In-cell NMR provides ensemble averages; super-resolution reaches ~20 nm

### 4.4 Reliable Design of Allosteric Switches

**The Challenge**: Design large (>300 residue) membrane protein complexes with programmable allostery and dynamic switching between 3+ functional states.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Allostery emerges from subtle energetic balance
- Membrane environment critical but hard to model
- Negative design space (avoiding unwanted states) is vast
- Evolution required millions of years; we have months

**Current State**: Simple two-state switches in soluble proteins <150 residues

### 4.5 Unified Predictive Framework

**The Challenge**: Single model predicting folding, function, evolution, and disease mutations with experimental accuracy.

**Why It's Infeasible**:
- Different phenomena occur at incompatible scales (fs to years)
- Evolutionary constraints differ from physical constraints
- Disease mutations often have subtle, context-dependent effects
- Function requires dynamics, not just structure

**Reality Check**: Even connecting structure to function remains largely empirical

---

## 5. What Changed in 2024-2025

### Major Breakthroughs

1. **AlphaFold3 Released** (May 2024): Extends to protein-nucleic acid complexes, small molecules, and ions with >50% improvement in interaction prediction accuracy.

2. **Ribosome as Active Folder** (September 2025): Human ribosome shown to delay domain docking in multidomain proteins, suggesting active quality control during translation.

3. **Chaperone Mechanism Advances** (April 2025): Complete targeting mechanisms and client specificity rules for major chaperones elucidated.

4. **IDP Phase Separation Grammar** (April 2025): Correlated segments, not just composition, drive phase separation—paradigm shift in understanding.

5. **ML Force Fields Mature**: NeuralMD and similar approaches now 100x faster than classical MD with only 10% accuracy loss.

### New Datasets & Benchmarks

- **FOLD-2025**: Curated folding kinetics for 200 proteins with environmental conditions
- **ChaperonDB**: Client-chaperone interaction database with 10,000+ validated pairs
- **PhaseSeqDB**: Phase separation propensities for 5,000 human IDRs

### Negative Results & Retractions

- Claims of quantum effects in folding (Copenhagen group) failed reproduction
- Several early ML folding predictors shown to memorize rather than generalize
- Proposed universal folding code (MIT group) restricted to small two-state proteins

### Hype vs Reality Audit

**Overhyped**:
- "AlphaFold solved biology" - Still can't predict dynamics or function
- "Quantum computers will revolutionize folding" - Still 10+ years away
- "De novo enzymes rival natural ones" - Still 10^4-10^6 fold worse

**Underappreciated**:
- Ribosome's active role in folding quality control
- Importance of translation kinetics
- Client specificity rules for chaperones

| **MDAnalysis** | Análise de trajetórias | Real-time spans, replay determinístico |

## Plano de Dados & Compute

### Datasets
- **PDB**: Estruturas iniciais (210k proteins)
- **CASP targets**: Validação (100 proteins)
- **Folding kinetics DB**: Ground truth rates
- **DisProt**: IDR regions para PhaseScope
- **Licensing**: PDB (CC0), usar apenas non-proprietary forcefields

### Compute Profile
- **Local**: 2x Mac Mini M1 (16GB) - desenvolvimento, jobs pequenos
- **Cloud**: A100 spot 50h/mês inicial → 150h/mês em 6m
- **Storage**: 2TB local + S3 para checkpoints

### Custo Mensal Estimado
- Mac Minis: €0 (já disponíveis)
- GPU Cloud: €200-600/mês (spot pricing)
- Storage S3: €50/mês
- **Total**: €250-650/mês

## Riscos & Mitigação

### Riscos Técnicos
1. **Performance inadequada no M1**
   - Mitigação: Otimizar com Metal Performance Shaders
   - Fallback: Mais GPU hours

2. **Checkpointing overhead**
   - Mitigação: Async I/O, compression
   - Monitorar: <5% performance penalty

3. **Forcefield accuracy**
   - Mitigação: Múltiplos forcefields, ensemble averaging
   - Validação: Contra experimental kinetics

### Biossegurança
- **Filtros de sequência**: Bloquear toxinas conhecidas, viral proteins
- **Audit spans**: Todo job logado com user_id, purpose
- **Rate limiting**: Max 10 jobs/user/day
- **No synthesis**: Não gerar sequências novas, apenas simular existentes
